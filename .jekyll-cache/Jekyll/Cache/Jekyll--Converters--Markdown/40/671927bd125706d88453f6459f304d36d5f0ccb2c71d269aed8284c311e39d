    <p> The main objective of this project is to research and design a novel electronic device that leverages ISFET sensor to study variables and chemical characteristics of a substance that need to be analyzed without the need of a laboratory analysis. When applied to the agri-food sector, this device will allow the optimization of fertilization or water and crops treatment processes utilizing the gathered real time knowledge of the previously mentioned variables. </p>

    <p> This research project proposes a leap from the current conception of robotic laparoscopic surgery, focused on tele-operated robots. It proposes a co-worker robot within the concept of surgery 4.0 able to assist the surgeon in procedures of laparoscopic sutures. The robotic system will be composed by five arms: a cameraman robot, two tele-operated arms with haptics capabilities, and two autonomous robotic arms. This assistance will be developed thanks to fault-tolerant cognitive architecture with intervention supervision, which uses a qualitative representation of the workflow in order to plan the actuations to assist to the surgeon. These actuations will be executed by a fault tolerance motion control able to coordinate the different arm movements. </p>

    <p> In this innovative experimental development project, a neurorehabilitation platform will be developed (M3Rob - Mind - Hand - Robot Wrist), that will allow the realization of new therapies to address, simultaneously, the rehabilitation of cognitive and neuromotor functions, for patients who have suffered a stroke. With this platform, patients will be able to perform therapies oriented to activities of daily living for neuromotor rehabilitation, and it will also allow training / rehabilitating the higher cognitive functions affected by their injury. This approach to neuromotor and cognitive rehabilitation will improve the patient’s rehabilitation and benefit from the combined effects of both therapeutic approaches. </p>

    <p> This project aims to develop RobHand robot, a new robot for hand rehabilitation, through active therapies, for patients who have neuromotor disability due to a Vascular Brain Accident. It is an exoskeleton type robot, conceived to provide active therapies related to the rehabilitation of hand grip and pronation / supination of the forearm. This robotic device will allow the development of adequate motor control to achieve a “fine” manipulation of the objects, adapted to the different grip strategies that each patient can implement. The aim of this new design is to provide a more complete rehabilitation platform, adaptable to patients with a greater number of deficiencies thanks to an improvement in several areas: improvement in the mechanical structure, making it “transparent”, improving control haptic to provide assistance tailored to the needs of the patient, improving the design and implementation of virtual environments for therapies, so that they are motivating and friendly. </p>

    <p> The main objective of the project is the creation, development, implantation and clinical tests of a new prototype of intelligent robotic device, with a terminal grip (“end-effector” in Anglo-Saxon terminology), for neuro-rehabilitation of the upper limbs, in patients with Acquired brain damage. This robot will allow the realization of auto-adapted neuro-rehabilitation therapies “on-line” to the needs of each patient (paradigm “assistance as needed”), through control strategies based on haptic, physiological and visual feedback. </p>

    <p> The project that is being developed studies the extension of the concept of robotic system “co-worker”, within a cognitive learning scheme, applied to the endonasal approach. It will provide the neurosurgeon with safety in the intervention through assistance in the form of automatic, collaborative, or shared control movements, as well as with augmented reality. The robotic system will adapt to the ergonomics of the intervention, perform a precise surgical navigation, based on the online information provided to measure the brain-shift effect and take into account the pre-operative planning. Also, it will have an automatic exchanger of surgical tools. In this way, the robotic system will incorporate within a fault tolerant cognitive architecture, a movement control system that avoids damage to the nasal passages, a collaborative movement planner with learning capacity and a mathematical model for the prediction of three-dimensional displacements. of the brain based on intra-operative information. </p>

    <p> The developed project addressed the development of a robotic system oriented to the HALS approach and framed within the “co-worker” robot concept, where the machine works side by side with the surgeon, collaborating in the surgical maneuvers and learning from the practice. For this, the robotic system that is proposed is formed by a manipulator capable of operating an articulated laparoscopic tool and an endoscope, and another specialized in the movement of mini-robots within the abdominal cavity. On the other hand, it includes a person-machine interface based on an intelligent surgical glove and the ability to emulate the concept of “transparent abdomen” by combining real image with augmented reality. </p>

    <p> This project addresses the development of new robotic tools useful for the two types of techniques named above and that cover both the preoperative and the intraoperative. Specifically, the design and development of a robotic platform capable of placing inside the abdominal cavity a micro-robot equipped with sensors and surgical tools that work collaboratively with the surgeon is undertaken. The system is programmed offline to establish the master plan during the intervention and intraoperatively through a multi-modal person-machine interface. On the other hand, the robotic system consists of two positioning arms and a micro robot, so that the first two, through the use of magnetic fields, will displace and locate the third in the operative field inside the abdomen. As a configuration of one of the positioning robotic arms, a hyper-redundant structure has been considered that will hold the micro-robot at its end to enter the interior of the abdominal cavity. The micro-robot will be able to detach from the hyper-redundant structure, and by means of the other positioning arm, which will have a standard configuration, it will move from the outside of the abdominal wall through the use of a magnetic field. The micro-robot can deploy small arms in which cameras, touch sensors, light sources or small surgical tools will be located. </p>
