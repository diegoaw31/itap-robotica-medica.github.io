<p>The minimally invasive surgery involved the acquisition of new skills by the surgeons and the creation of new tools, a place where robotics was an invaluable aid. The current trend is aimed at reducing the incisions that are practiced on the patient’s body to a minimum. In this way, the SILS (Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery) and NOTES (Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery) techniques appear, where a new generation of robotic tools are required.</p>

<p>This project addresses the development of new robotic tools useful for the two types of techniques named above and that cover both the preoperative and the intraoperative. Specifically, the design and development of a robotic platform capable of placing inside the abdominal cavity a micro-robot equipped with sensors and surgical tools that work collaboratively with the surgeon is undertaken. The system is programmed offline to establish the master plan during the intervention and intraoperatively through a multi-modal person-machine interface. On the other hand, the robotic system consists of two positioning arms and a micro robot, so that the first two, through the use of magnetic fields, will displace and locate the third in the operative field inside the abdomen. As a configuration of one of the positioning robotic arms, a hyper-redundant structure has been considered that will hold the micro-robot at its end to enter the interior of the abdominal cavity. The micro-robot will be able to detach from the hyper-redundant structure, and by means of the other positioning arm, which will have a standard configuration, it will move from the outside of the abdominal wall through the use of a magnetic field. The micro-robot can deploy small arms in which cameras, touch sensors, light sources or small surgical tools will be located.</p>
