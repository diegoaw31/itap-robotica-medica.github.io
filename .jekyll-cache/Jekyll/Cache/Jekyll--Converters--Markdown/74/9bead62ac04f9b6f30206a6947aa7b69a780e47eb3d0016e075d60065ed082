<p>Research in medical robotics and rehabilitation robotics within the medical robotics research group of ITAP focuses on providing real solutions to surgical, healthcare and rehabilitation challenges. The two lines of research in which this group works are:</p>

<h2 id="rehabilitation-robotics">Rehabilitation robotics</h2>

<p>Design, control and manufacture of robotic devices for rehabilitation tasks of upper limbs in people with neuromotor disability. In this line of research, mechatronic robot-assisted exercise devices are developed that significantly improve the success rate in neurological rehabilitation therapy to relearn the movement abilities of the upper limbs (arm and hand). Neurological rehabilitation treatment to relearn movement capabilities after a stroke, paraplegia or traumatic brain injury is based on intensive movement therapy over a period of several weeks and months, sometimes even years. This therapy helps patients to relearn the daily movements of arms and hands. The arms and hands are guided repeatedly in natural movements so that the healthy areas of the brain can learn successively to control the paralyzed limbs. Robot-assisted therapy exercise devices can relieve therapists of heavy, monotonous physical work, while increasing the intensity of patient therapy. Clinical studies in patients treated with robotic-assisted therapy exercise devices show a greatly improved success rate compared to patients treated with conventional therapy.</p>

<p>This line of research is developed through projects with the companies CyL ImasD S.L. and Aplifisa, projects funded by the CDTI.</p>

<p>In this line of research, we collaborate very actively with the rehabilitation service of the University Clinical Hospital of Valladolid, directed by Dr. Emilio J. Barajas.</p>

<h2 id="laparoscopic-surgery">Laparoscopic surgery</h2>

<p>Design and control of robotic assistants for minimally invasive surgery. This type of surgery is performed with instruments and visualization equipment inserted into the body through small incisions created by the surgeon, unlike open surgery with large incisions. This minimizes surgical trauma and damage to healthy tissues, which reduces the patient’s recovery time. Unfortunately, there are disadvantages due to the dexterity reduction, the workspace, and the sensory input for the surgeon that is only available through a single video image. In this line of research, control strategies and mechatronic devices are developed that help the surgeon during the surgical intervention.</p>

<p>In this line of research projects are carried out in collaboration with the medical robotics group of the University of Malaga led by Dr. Victor Muñoz, and with the NBIO group of the Miguel Hernández de Elche University, directed by Dr. José María Sabater .</p>

Our overarching goal is to explore and understand new quantum states of electronic matter on the atomic scale. To do so, we use and develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom.

Our goal is to build instruments and develop techniques that enable us to address the questions we find most interesting. This is possible thanks also to Milan's broad background with different research themes and technologies: he learned his trade in [Seamus Davis’ SI-STM lab](http://davisgroup.lassp.cornell.edu/) and with [Felix Baumberger](http://dpmc.unige.ch/gr_baumberger/index.html), and later moved as an [ETH fellow](http://www.ethfellows.ethz.ch/) to [Andreas Wallraff’s qudev lab](http://www.qudev.ethz.ch/) where he investigated coupled cavity arrays in circuit QED. We further have group members with different background and interests, working together on physics and instrumentation.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Scanning tunneling noise spectroscopy (STNS).** We have developed a novel cryogenic MHz amplifier that allows us to measure not only the average tunneling current, but also its fluctuation! This has many applications: one can detect the fluctuations of the electronic states, peculiar tunneling processes, and shot noise. We have used this instrument to discover charge trapping in the insulating layer of the cuprates, connected to the c-axis mystery, and to measure the doubling of the charge due to Andreev processes to the superfluid in a lead sample.


**Mott physics and high-temperature superconductivity.** Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? What is the mechanism of dissipation in that state? (iii), Why is the transition temperature in high-temperature superconductors so high? We have worked on iridates, rhodates, and cuprates.

**Nanofabricated "Smart Tips"**.
![](http://localhost:4000/images/respic/SmartTip.png){: style="width: 250px; float: left; margin: 0px  10px"}
One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.

**Josephson STM.** Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.

We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.

**Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.**  ![](http://localhost:4000/images/respic/STMHead.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.


**Strange Metals.** The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the 'Strange Metal consortium NL' that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren. 

**Magnetic fluctuations and electron spin resonance.**
![](http://localhost:4000/images/respic/SpinFluc.png){: style="width: 70%; float: center; margin: 10px"}

**Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.**
We have proposed that artificial super-periodicities can lead to improved superconductivity, both because of increased density of states and because of phase space arguments (see image from our SciPost publication below). Perhaps for different reasons, twisted bilayer graphene has been shown to superconduct! We are investigate this material with the groups of Efetov, Baumberger, and van der Molen.
