- title: "SURGICAL MULTI-ROBOT COORDINATION â€“ ROBOTIC ANASTOMOSIS COMPETENCE EVALUATION"
  description: 
    "
    This research project proposes a leap from the current conception of robotic laparoscopic surgery, 
    focused on tele-operated robots. It proposes a co-worker robot within the concept of surgery 4.0 able to assist the surgeon in procedures of laparoscopic sutures. 
    The robotic system will be composed by five arms: a cameraman robot, two tele-operated arms with haptics capabilities, and two autonomous robotic arms. 
    This assistance will be developed thanks to fault-tolerant cognitive architecture with intervention supervision, 
    which uses a qualitative representation of the workflow in order to plan the actuations to assist to the surgeon. 
    These actuations will be executed by a fault tolerance motion control able to coordinate the different arm movements.
